LOH
hiding (easein/out) side menu

TOCO
- Better font
- Animate bar chart then fade in win count
- Draw pie chart, then add settings switch (or click is fine I guess)
- Emoji x/o's
- Picture frame
- Sound effects

- Animate wins (on a repeating interval)
- Show who goes first (best to alternate players)
- Sound effects ('x' sound, 'o' sound, celebration sound, configurable by player so they can have their own victory music)
- Over the network (so can play with friends!)
- Friend list / ATVL 'send invitation to play' based on email / playerid / phone id / number (so no database required?  May still have to verify phone number locally, e.g. by sending text message)
- Challenge: possible without DB?  Can send a push notification using device id, perhaps?

Layout
- Scroll the screen for super large layouts so it doesn't break
- If going to allow for resize (e.g. pinch to zoom) will need better letter centering
